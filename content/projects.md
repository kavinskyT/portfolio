### Prediction of patients with liver disease 

In this Python project, I performed data exploration, cleaning, and applied machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset of patients with and without liver disease. Using libraries like *NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn*, I built a predictive model to assess the likelihood of liver disease. This involved preprocessing the data, visualizing trends, and training a classification model to predict the presence of the disease, aiming to aid in early diagnosis and healthcare decisions.

### Data Visualization on CAIâ€™s accomodation facilities

In this project, I analyzed a dataset containing information about mountain huts owned by the Italian Mountain Club. After conducting data exploration and cleaning, I created a tidy dataset to perform visualizations. I highlighted the geographical distribution of the huts and explored the relationship between their location, altitude, and available services. The project utilized the Tidyverse collection of packages, with a focus on ggplot2 for creating insightful visual representations.

### Optimal Snow Producer Configuration w/ TechnoAlpin

During my studies I had the opportunity to collaborate with [TechnoAlpin](https://www.technoalpin.com/en/) on the development of an optimization algorithm that minimises the number of snow producers and the power consumption on a ski slope. I Utilised Python geopandas library, knowledge on Coordinate Reference System (CRS) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to manipulate geodata and model every aspect of a ski slope. I Developed two ground-base approaches that automatically suggest a configuration of producers that ensures a balanced distribution of snow on the slope.
