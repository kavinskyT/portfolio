### Prediction of patients with liver disease 

In this project, I performed data exploration, cleaning, and applied machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset of patients with and without liver disease. Using libraries like *NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn*, I built a predictive model to assess the likelihood of liver disease. This involved preprocessing the data, visualizing trends, and training a classification model to predict the presence of the disease, aiming to aid in early diagnosis and healthcare decisions.
