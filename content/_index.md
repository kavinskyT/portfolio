# Welcome!

![A picture of me](img/me.jpg)

I'm Andrea Toaiari. I'm a Master Graduate in Data Science at Free University of Bolzano. I have always been curious about the IT world, and during my studies, I developed a strong interest in making data both interesting and interpretable. I'm fascinated by Deep Learning, not only for its potential but also for the complex mechanisms behind it. My goal is to find a role that allows me to combine my passion for data analysis with the cutting-edge techniques of deep learning, enabling me to uncover meaningful insights and drive innovative solutions. 

During the last year, I have gained interest the Computer Vision field and I did my internship and my thesis at [Covision Lab](https://www.covisionlab.com/en), in Brixen. I focused on Visual Foundation Models, such as DiNOv2, DepthAnything and Unidepth, to investigate their performance in depth estimation task and to use their generated depth maps to assist Monocular SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) systems in estimating an autonomous car trajectory. The results were used to write my thesis 'Foundation Models applied to Depth Estimation for SLAM problem', under the supervision of [Prof. Lanz Oswald](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vpmV4xcAAAAJ).
